# Deep Reinforcement Learning on Several Environments

## Description

This repository contains the code and materials for my 4th-year university project in Artificial Intelligence. The project focuses on implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve various environments.

## Environments

The project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the following environments:

1. Line World: This is a simple one-dimensional environment where an agent moves left or right to reach a goal position.

2. Grid World: A classic two-dimensional grid-world environment where the agent navigates through a grid, facing obstacles and rewards.

3. Tic Tac Toe: A popular board game implemented as an environment for the agent to learn to play using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

4. Secret Environments: There are additional secret environments that will not be disclosed here, as they are part of the surprise challenges in the project.

## Requirements

- Python3
- pygame
- numpy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:divinoPV/deep_reinforcement_learning_on_several_envs.git
```

2. Access the project directory.
```bash
cd deep_reinforcement_learning_on_several_envs
```

## Run

1. Run different algorithms in all environments.
```bash
python3 main.py
```

2. Running the tic-tac-toe graphical interface.
```bash
python3 tic_tac_toe.py
```
